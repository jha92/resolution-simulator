Calculator class for telescope track resolution using the General Broken Lines formalism.

This small collection of scripts provides a simple interface for the simulation of telescope resolutions including the effects of multiple scattering in the telescope planes and the surrounding air.


### Features

* Error propagation of track extrapolation uncertainty using GBL
* Includes scattering in material, estimated via the PDG Highland formula
* Automatically accounts for air between the telescope planes
* Allows to exchange the volume material considered for scattering (Air, vacuum, Helium...)
* Automatic placement of the thin scatterers at correct positions
* Planes ordered automatically in `z` for correct GBL trajectory building
* Radiation length for some common materials are defined in `utils/materials.h`
* The scattering is correctly treated by using the total scattering material of the track and weighting the individual scatterer contributions with their respective material budget.


### Installation

* Install and source ROOT (from https://root.cern.ch/), either ROOT5 or ROOT6 will work fine.

* Install GBL
  (from https://www.wiki.terascale.de/index.php/GeneralBrokenLines)

  ```
  svn checkout http://svnsrv.desy.de/public/GeneralBrokenLines/tags/V01-18-00/cpp GeneralBrokenLines
  cd GeneralBrokenLines
  mkdir build && cd build/
  cmake ..
  make && make install
  ```

* Export the GBL library path:
  ```
  export GBLPATH=/path/to/gbl/installation
  ```
  If you exactly follow the above description for GBL installation, it will simply be
  ```
  cd ../
  export GBLPATH=`pwd`
  ```
  
* Clone and compile the GBL Track Resolution Calculator:

  ```
  cd ../
  git clone https://github.com/simonspa/resolution-simulator.git && cd resolution-simulator/
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```
  All binaries are now in the build directory under `build/devices/`

### Prepare your own telescope simulation

* All telescope assemblies are stored in the `devices` directory.
* Take one of the provided examples, adapt it to your needs and simply store the `.cc` file in the `devices` directory. CMake will automatically create a build target and compile an executable with the same name as the source file.
* Have a look at the `devices/tscope_datura.cc` example for some explanatory comments on how to build the telescope assembly.

### Further instructions and hints

* The resolution can only be evaluated at a previously defined plane. This can either be a plane with measurements, a scatterer, or a plane with no material attached. They can be defined as follows:

  `gblsim::plane measurement(position, material, TRUE, resolution);` - plane with measurement and scattering material

  `gblsim::plane scatterer(position, material, FALSE);` - plane with scattering material but no measurement

  `gblsim::plane reference(position, 0, FALSE);` - plane with zero material and no measurement (simple reference point)


* The material budget is always given as fractions of radiation lengths. Thus, divide your material thickness by its radiation length, and add up different materials as linear sum, e.g.

  ```
  // MIMOSA26 telescope planes consist of 50um silicon plus 2x25um Kapton foil:
  double MIM26 = 50e-3 / X0_Si + 50e-3 / X0_Kapton;
  ```

* The resolution should always be given as intrinsic resolution of the respective sensor in units of micrometer.

* The constructor of the telescope class takes the radiation length of the surrounding volume as optional parameter:

  `telescope(std::vector<gblsim::plane> planes, double beam_energy, double material = X0_Air);`

  It defaults to the radiation length of dry air but can be replaced with other materials or with vacuum (`X0 = 0`) for comparison.
